## dotfiles

## Intro

This README will serve as a reference for all the tools used in making this rice as well
as credits for inspiration and the location where specific tips and tricks were found. It
will also contain links to most resources used with this config (wallpapers, themes, etc.)

### Quick Start

1. Install the required packages. They can be found below. That list is kept current as
   much as possible, but it is very much a "best effort", sometimes I forget things.
2. Run the install script from this repo, which will just create symlinks from the dotfiles
   in this repo to the correct locations on your system. This is done with
   [dotbot](https://git.io/dotbot).
3. Download my wallpaper [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/h8ezpz/into_the_woods/).
4. Download some icons that you like, I use
   [papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/).
5. Download a nice gtk theme, mine is [Nordic](https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic).
6. Use `lxappearance` to select the right gtk theme.
7. Update monitor configurations to suit your needs.
  a. Create `autorandr` profiles.
    i. Create custom profiles.
    ii. Symlink `default` to a desired virtual profile.
  b. Update `bspwmrc` to suit your monitor configuration and use the profiles.

### Install Script

**Note:** commands that are run by dotbot (in `install.conf.yaml`)
will be ran using the shell specified in `$SHELL`. I use [fish](https://fishshell.com), so the
shell commands will probably not work on other shells. Before running the install script,
edit the commands for your own shell, or switch to fish!

To install my configurations, you just have to clone this repo and run `./install`. I
recommend checking the `install.conf.yaml` file before blindly installing because it
will expect specific directories to exist which you might not have. Also it's good
practice not to run random commands you find.

## Details

### Backlight

By default, only root has access to change the screen brightness. To allow other users to do it without sudo (which will be
necessary to use keyboard shortcuts), follow instructions on the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight#ACPI).

### Fish Functions

I added some functions to Fish for convenience. Some are just aliases, some are small scripts which just make
life that much easier.

- `clip.fish` [ A nice alias for the X clipboard. Things can be piped to it to add them to the clipboard. ]
- `jsink.fish` [ A script to add/remove/list JACK-enabled PulseAudio sinks. This enables moving audio from
                 specific applications through JACK easily, which allows fine-grained processing. For example,
                 sending audio from a music player through a DAW before combining it with a microphone input
                 for live streaming. ]
- `ranger.fish` [ A simple alias for ranger to remain in the same directory on exit. ]
- `ssh.fish` [ An alias for SSH to set `$TERM` to `xterm-256color` to ensure compatibility on remote hosts 
-              (instead of using `alacritty` which requires adding something to the terminfo entries). ]
- `wacom.fish` [ A small script to map my Wacom tablet to a given display. If you choose to use this, make
  sure you edit it so it works with your tablet. It's very simple to do, just edit the `awk` command.
  You should change what I put there for the name of your own stylus. You can find it with `xinput list`. ]

### Notes

#### backups

A backup solution is really important these days, so [cron](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cron)
should be used to run daily backups. Those backups can be made using the `backup.sh` script
in this repo. For this to work, a few things have to be setup.

1. Have the [cronie](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=cronie) package installed.
2. Have a [borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) repo located at `~/.backup`.
3. Have your passphrase for the repo stored in `~/.config/borg/passphrase`.
4. Edit the line in `backup.sh` where the backup is uploaded to amazon s3 to make sure that :
   - You are using a bucket that you own.
   - You are using a profile with write access to that bucket.
5. Edit `root`'s crontab to run `anacron` every minute, which might look like this :
   - `* * * * * anacron`
6. Edit `/etc/anacrontab` to make sure the backup runs at the frequency you want it to.
   Here is an example :
   - `@daily 5 backup.daily su -c "/usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/lock.backup /home/{path to script}/backup.sh" -s /bin/sh {your username}`
   - The `flock` part is important because you don't want to run two backups at the same time.
     This will also run the backup script as your own user, so you will still own the borg archive.
   - Also, if you want to receive a notification that the backup completed with logs,
     you can add `&& {command to send yourself an email}` after the script, or something similar.
     The other option for emails is to configure a mail server that makes the `sendmail` command
     available, though this option is a lot more complicated to set-up.
7. Enable cron with `sudo systemctl enable cronie` and `sudo systemctl start cronie`.

**Why run anacron as root?** : This is usually how it's done, which is written down in the man page.

#### env variables

Environment variables should be modified to make sure everything works well in this setup.
Make sure those variables don't exist before running the command or it won't work. If they
already exist, follow the instructions [here](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/faq.html#why-doesn-t-set-ux-exported-universal-variables-seem-to-work).

1. `set -Ux SHELL /usr/bin/fish`
2. `set -Ux XDG_CONFIG_HOME \$HOME/.config`
3. `set -U fish_user_paths \$HOME/.local/bin $fish_user_paths`
4. `set -U fish_user_paths \$HOME/.cargo/bin $fish_user_paths` (if using Rust)

Some of these variables will be set in `~/.profile` to make sure they exist when other processes
get launched from a bash shell, or something which needs `~/.profile`. Note that `~/.cargo/bin`
is added to the path in `~/.profile`.

#### monitors and hot-plugging

This part of the setup warrants some additional details, because it is non-trivial.
The main thing is the `bin/autorandr.sh` script in this repository, which can do a
few different things, the main of which being saving display configurations and loading
the correct configuration (profile) when it's detected.

The script's features were taken from [autorandr](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr),
but implemented in a simpler and more reliable way. The key difference is that the script does
not try to parse `xrandr` output for display configuration and save that. Instead, `arandr`
is used to save a configuration (which works better than `autorandr` for this purpose).
Fingerprinting the display configuration works in much the same way than `autorandr`, though.
Another difference is that the script does not respond to hot-plug events. Instead, reloading
the `bspwm` config calls the script, which then updates the display configuration.

There are, however, some gotchas with regards to monitor management. Most notably, it doesn't
seem possible to move desktops from one monitor to another while preserving all the nodes and
their positioning in bspwm.

Also, there seems to be an issue with polybar if the top of two different monitors aren't
lined up. Essentially, it will add a large amount of padding at the top of monitors so that
the top of windows all line up below the bar (regardless of whether or not there is a bar
on the monitor that has the padding). A work-around for this is to wait for polybar's config
to be applied before manually removing the padding afterwards in `bspwmrc`.

The `bin/autorandr.sh` script works with profiles, so to work with these dotfiles, you will
need to create your own profiles and edit `bspwmrc` to recognize those profiles.
